## Joining an Existing Engagement

## 📝 Context

You're joining an engagement that's already in progress. Someone else started it, and
now you're being added to help or take over part of it. Get up to speed quickly
without disrupting what's already working.

## 📋 First 24 Hours Checklist

- [ ] Understand why you're being added (capacity, expertise, handoff?)
- [ ] Identify who's currently leading and what their role is
- [ ] Review all existing documentation (notes, status updates, handoff docs)
- [ ] Check CRM/tracking system for full engagement history
- [ ] Sync with current lead SE 👥 to understand current state
- [ ] Identify what you're responsible for vs. what others own
- [ ] Understand customer expectations and communication cadence

## 🎯 Getting Up to Speed

**Understand the Current State**

- What stage is the engagement? (Discovery, POC, implementation, post-sale?)
- What's been completed so far?
- What's currently in progress?
- What are the open issues or blockers?
- Who are the key stakeholders? (Customer and internal)

**Review Existing Work**

- Read all status updates and trip reports
- Review technical documentation and architecture notes
- Check for any handoff documents
- Review customer communication history
- Understand what's been promised or committed

**Clarify Your Role**

- What are you responsible for? (Specific tasks, customer contacts, technical areas)
- Who else is involved and what do they own?
- What's the communication model? (Daily standups, weekly syncs, async updates?)
- Who makes decisions? (You, lead SE, team consensus?)

## 🎯 Integration Steps

**Week 1: Observe and Learn**

1. **Attend existing meetings** - Don't skip customer calls or internal syncs
   - Listen more than you speak initially
   - Understand the dynamic and communication style
   - Note who the key decision makers are

2. **Review technical work** - Understand what's been deployed or configured
   - Review architecture and configuration
   - Understand the environment setup
   - Know what's working and what's not

3. **Build relationships** - Introduce yourself appropriately
   - Customer: "I'm joining to help with [X], looking forward to working together"
   - Internal: Sync with lead SE and understand how they work

4. **Document gaps** - Note what you don't understand yet
   - Ask questions in internal channels (not customer-facing)
   - Fill in your knowledge gaps
   - Don't pretend to know things you don't

**Week 2+: Start Contributing**

- Take ownership of specific tasks or areas
- Communicate proactively about your work
- Don't duplicate what others are doing
- Escalate blockers or questions appropriately

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Not reviewing existing work - you'll ask questions that were already answered
- Disrupting existing workflows - understand how things work before changing them
- Taking over without permission - clarify roles and ownership
- Not communicating with the team - you're joining, not replacing
- Assuming you understand everything - ask questions early
