## Inherited Customer

## 📝 Context

You're taking over a customer from another SE who's rolling off. This is a full
handoff - you're now the owner. Get everything you need to succeed without
disrupting the customer relationship.

## 📋 Pre-Handoff Checklist

- [ ] Confirm handoff timeline and transition period
- [ ] Request handoff document from outgoing SE
- [ ] Review all existing documentation (notes, status updates, technical docs)
- [ ] Check CRM/tracking system for full engagement history
- [ ] Understand current engagement status and next steps
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders (customer and internal)
- [ ] Schedule handoff call with outgoing SE 👥

## 🎯 Handoff Process

**Get the Handoff Document**

- Request [handoff document](../internal/handoff-to-se.md) from outgoing SE
- Review it thoroughly before the handoff call
- Note any gaps or questions you have
- Understand what's been done, what's in progress, and what's open

**Handoff Call with Outgoing SE** ⏱️ 30-60 min

- Walk through the handoff document together
- Ask about things not in the docs (politics, preferences, personalities)
- Understand the customer's communication style
- Learn about any ongoing issues or concerns
- Get access to all systems, docs, and channels
- Understand what the customer expects next

**Review Technical State**

- Review architecture and current deployment
- Understand environment setup and configuration
- Know what's working and what's not
- Review any open technical issues
- Understand upgrade/maintenance schedule

**Understand Customer Context**

- Who are the key contacts? (Decision makers, technical contacts, day-to-day)
- What's their communication preference? (Email, Slack, calls, frequency)
- What's the relationship history? (Any issues, wins, preferences?)
- What are their expectations? (Response time, availability, support model)
- Any politics or sensitivities to be aware of?

## 🎯 Transition Steps

**Week 1: Introduction and Handoff**

1. **Customer introduction** - Outgoing SE introduces you
   - "I'm transitioning this to [Your Name], who will be taking over"
   - You: "Looking forward to working with you, I'm here to ensure continuity"

2. **Attend existing meetings** - Don't miss scheduled calls
   - Observe the dynamic and communication style
   - Start building your own relationship
   - Take notes on what you learn

3. **Take over communication** - Gradually transition
   - Outgoing SE may CC you initially
   - You start responding and leading
   - Outgoing SE fades out over transition period

4. **Get access to everything** - Systems, docs, channels
   - Customer environment access
   - Internal documentation and channels
   - CRM and tracking systems
   - Any shared resources or tools

**Week 2+: Full Ownership**

- You're now the primary contact
- Take ownership of all open items
- Establish your own communication cadence
- Build your own relationship with the customer
- Update documentation with your own notes

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Not getting a proper handoff - insist on handoff document and call
- Skipping the handoff call - you'll miss critical context
- Not reviewing existing documentation - you'll ask questions already answered
- Disrupting the relationship - maintain continuity, don't change everything at once
- Not understanding customer expectations - they may have specific preferences
- Missing ongoing issues - understand what's broken or in progress
- Not getting access to systems - discover this early, not when you need it
