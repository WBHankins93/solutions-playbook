## New Customer Engagement

## 📝 Context

You just got assigned a new customer or prospect. This is your starting point - what
to do first, who to talk to, and how to get oriented quickly.

## 📋 First 24 Hours Checklist

- [ ] Review assignment details (who assigned it, why, what stage)
- [ ] Check CRM/tracking system for existing notes
- [ ] Review any existing documentation or past interactions
- [ ] Sync with sales rep 👥 to understand deal context
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders (customer side and internal)
- [ ] Understand what stage they're at (discovery, POC, implementation)
- [ ] Schedule initial sync with sales if needed

## 🎯 Getting Oriented

**Understand the Context**

- What's the deal status? (Prospect, POC, signed?)
- What product/solution are they evaluating?
- What's the revenue potential? Timeline pressure?
- Any politics or sensitivities to be aware of?
- Who else is involved internally? (Sales, other SEs, leadership)

**Review Existing Information**

- Check CRM for notes, call recordings, emails
- Look for any technical documentation or architecture notes
- Review past status updates or trip reports
- Check if there's a handoff document from another SE
- Look for any environment-specific notes or constraints

**Identify Next Steps**

- Is there a discovery call scheduled? → [Discovery Call](../pre-sales/discovery.md)
- Is there a demo coming up? → [Demo](../pre-sales/demo.md)
- Is there a POC in scope? → [POC Scoping](../pre-sales/poc-scoping.md)
- Is this moving to implementation? → [Kickoff](../implementation/kickoff.md)

## 🎯 Initial Actions

**Week 1 Priorities**

1. **Sync with sales** 👥 - Understand deal context and desired outcome
   - Use [Pre-call prep](../internal/pre-call-prep.md) framework
   - Know who the decision maker is
   - Understand timeline and pressure points

2. **Review or schedule discovery** - If not done yet, get discovery call on calendar
   - Use [Discovery Call](../pre-sales/discovery.md) guide
   - Understand their environment and constraints
   - Identify any red flags early

3. **Establish communication channels** - How will you communicate?
   - Email, Slack, Teams, phone?
   - Who's the primary point of contact?
   - What's the expected response time?

4. **Document what you learn** - Start building your knowledge base
   - Create notes in CRM or shared doc
   - Document key stakeholders and their roles
   - Note any constraints or special requirements

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Assuming you know what they need - always start with discovery
- Not syncing with sales first - you might walk into a minefield
- Missing existing documentation - don't duplicate work
- Not understanding the stage - discovery vs. POC vs. implementation require different approaches
- Skipping stakeholder mapping - know who decides vs. who evaluates
