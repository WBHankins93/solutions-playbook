## Escalation

## 📝 Context

The customer is frustrated, threatening to walk away, or the situation requires
leadership involvement. Escalation is a tool, not a failure. Use it strategically
to preserve the relationship and move forward.

## 📋 Pre-Escalation Checklist

- [ ] Have you tried to resolve this yourself?
- [ ] Do you understand the root cause of their frustration?
- [ ] Have you communicated transparently about the situation?
- [ ] Do you have a clear ask for leadership?
- [ ] Is this the right time to escalate? (Not too early, not too late)
- [ ] Have you briefed your manager on the situation?

## 🎯 When to Escalate

**Escalate If:**

- Customer is threatening to cancel or walk away
- Relationship is at risk and you can't repair it alone
- Issue requires leadership decision or authority
- Customer is asking to speak to your manager
- Situation is beyond your ability to resolve
- Deal is at risk and needs executive attention

**Don't Escalate If:**

- You haven't tried to resolve it yourself
- It's a routine technical issue you can solve
- Customer is just venting (not actually escalating)
- You haven't communicated with customer about it
- It's something you should handle at your level

## 🎯 Escalation Framework

**Step 1: Understand the Situation**

- What's the actual problem? (Not symptoms, root cause)
- Why is the customer frustrated?
- What do they want? (Be specific)
- What have you tried so far?
- What's the business impact? (Deal size, relationship value)

**Step 2: Prepare for Escalation**

- Brief your manager with full context
- Prepare a clear summary of the situation
- Identify what you need from leadership
- Have a proposed solution or path forward
- Gather any relevant documentation

**Step 3: Escalate Internally First**

- Brief your manager with:
  - Situation summary
  - What you've tried
  - What you need
  - Proposed next steps
- Get alignment on approach
- Identify who should be involved (sales, leadership, etc.)

**Step 4: Escalate to Customer**

- Acknowledge their concern directly
- "I understand your frustration, and I want to make sure we address this properly"
- Introduce leadership: "I'd like to bring in [Name] to ensure we get this right"
- Set up the call/meeting
- Don't throw anyone under the bus

**Step 5: Execute Escalation**

- Leadership should:
  - Listen to customer concerns
  - Acknowledge the issue
  - Take ownership
  - Propose a path forward
  - Commit to follow-up

**Step 6: Follow Through**

- Execute on commitments
- Communicate progress
- Don't let it happen again
- Document lessons learned

## 🎯 Escalation Communication

**To Your Manager**

"Hey [Name], I need to escalate [Customer] situation. They're [frustrated/concerned]
about [issue]. I've tried [X, Y, Z] but [reason it hasn't resolved]. The deal is
[at risk/important] and I think we need [leadership involvement/specific action].
Can we discuss how to proceed?"

**To Customer**

"I understand your concern about [issue]. I want to make sure we address this
properly, so I'd like to bring in [Name, Title] to ensure we get this right.
Can we schedule a call this week?"
