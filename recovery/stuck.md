## Stuck - Don't Know the Path Forward

## 📝 Context

You're stuck. You don't know what to do next, the path forward is unclear, or
you've tried everything you can think of. This happens. The key is to get unstuck
systematically rather than spinning your wheels.

## 📋 Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] What exactly are you stuck on? (Be specific)
- [ ] What have you tried so far?
- [ ] What's blocking you? (Technical, process, relationship, knowledge?)
- [ ] How long have you been stuck?
- [ ] What resources do you need that you don't have?
- [ ] Who might be able to help?

## 🎯 Getting Unstuck Framework

**Step 1: Define the Problem Clearly**

- What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
- What's preventing you from doing it?
- What have you tried?
- What's the specific blocker?

💡 Tip: Write it down. Often the act of articulating the problem reveals the solution.

**Step 2: Break It Down**

- Is this one big problem or several smaller ones?
- What's the smallest piece you can tackle?
- What would "good enough" look like?
- What's the minimum viable path forward?

**Step 3: Identify What You Need**

- Information? (Documentation, knowledge, context)
- Resources? (Access, tools, time)
- Help? (Expertise, perspective, decision)
- Permission? (Approval, buy-in, authority)

**Step 4: Find the Right Help**

- Technical issue? → [Requesting help](../internal/requesting-help.md) from engineering
- Process question? → Ask your manager or peers
- Customer issue? → [Escalation](escalation.md) or sales
- Knowledge gap? → Documentation, training, or subject matter expert
- Decision needed? → Escalate to decision maker

**Step 5: Take Action**

- Don't wait for perfect solution - take next step
- Even small progress is progress
- Validate your approach as you go
- Adjust course if needed

## 🎯 Common "Stuck" Scenarios

**Technical Blocker**

- Use [Troubleshooting](../implementation/troubleshooting.md) framework
- Timebox your debugging ⏱️ 30-60 min
- Ask for help using [Requesting help](../internal/requesting-help.md)
- Consider alternative approaches
- Don't spin your wheels indefinitely

**Unclear Requirements**

- Ask customer to clarify
- Document assumptions and validate them
- Break down into smaller questions
- Get alignment before proceeding

**Process or Approval Blocked**

- Identify who needs to approve
- Understand the approval process
- Escalate if process is blocking progress
- Find alternative paths if possible

**Knowledge Gap**

- Identify what you need to know
- Find documentation or training
- Ask subject matter experts
- Pair with someone who knows

**Relationship Issue**

- Address directly with the person
- Understand their perspective
- Find common ground
- Escalate if relationship is blocking work

**Decision Paralysis**

- Identify what decision is needed
- Gather information to inform decision
- Make decision with best available info
- Escalate if decision is above your level

## 🎯 When to Ask for Help

**Ask for Help If:**

- You've been stuck for more than 30-60 minutes
- You've tried obvious solutions
- You don't have the expertise needed
- You need information you can't get yourself
- The blocker is outside your control
- You're not making progress

**How to Ask:**

- Use [Requesting help](../internal/requesting-help.md) framework
- Be specific about what you need
- Show what you've tried
- Explain the impact/urgency
- Be open to suggestions

## 🎯 Alternative Approaches

**If Current Path Isn't Working:**

- What's an alternative way to achieve the goal?
- Can you simplify the approach?
- Is there a workaround?
- Can you defer this and tackle something else?
- What would "good enough" look like?

**If You're Waiting on Something:**

- Can you work on something else in parallel?
- Can you make progress with assumptions?
- Is there a way to unblock yourself?
- Should you escalate the blocker?

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Spinning your wheels - timebox and ask for help
- Not defining the problem clearly - write it down
- Waiting for perfect solution - take next step
- Not asking for help - you're not expected to know everything
- Giving up too early - many problems are solvable
- Not breaking it down - big problems are just small problems combined
