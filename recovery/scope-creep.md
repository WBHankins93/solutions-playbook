## Scope Creep

## 📝 Context

The customer is asking for things that weren't in the original scope. This happens
frequently - "just one more thing" adds up. Manage it proactively to avoid timeline
blowouts and relationship issues.

## 📋 Early Warning Signs

- [ ] Customer asks for "one small addition"
- [ ] Requests start with "while you're at it..."
- [ ] Timeline is slipping but scope seems to be growing
- [ ] You're doing things not in the scope document
- [ ] Success criteria keep expanding
- [ ] Customer says "I thought this was included"

## 🎯 Prevention Strategies

**During Scoping**

- Be explicit about what's out of scope
- Document scope clearly and get approval
- Set expectations about scope changes
- Include a scope change process in the scope doc

**During Execution**

- Refer back to scope document regularly
- Don't say yes to everything immediately
- Acknowledge requests but park them appropriately
- Track scope changes as they happen

## 🎯 Managing Scope Creep

**When They Ask for Something New**

1. **Acknowledge the request**
   - "That's a great idea/request"
   - Don't immediately say yes or no

2. **Check against scope**
   - Is it in the original scope?
   - If yes, do it
   - If no, proceed to step 3

3. **Park it appropriately**
   - "That's not in our current scope, but let's add it to [post-POC roadmap/follow-up/phase 2]"
   - "That would require scope adjustment - let me check what that means for timeline"

4. **Assess impact**
   - How much additional work?
   - Impact on timeline?
   - Impact on other priorities?
   - Is it critical or nice-to-have?

5. **Make decision**
   - If critical and small: Do it, document the change
   - If critical and large: Adjust scope formally
   - If nice-to-have: Park it for later

## 🎯 Scope Change Process

**For Small Additions**

- Acknowledge and do it if it's quick
- Document the addition
- Note it in status updates
- Don't let small additions accumulate silently

**For Significant Additions**

1. **Assess the request**
   - What exactly are they asking for?
   - How much additional work?
   - Impact on timeline and resources?

2. **Propose scope adjustment**
   - "To add [X], we'd need to [adjust timeline/extend POC/add resources]"
   - "That would require extending the timeline by [X] days/weeks"
   - "We could do that, but we'd need to [adjust other priorities]"

3. **Get formal approval**
   - Update scope document
   - Get customer sign-off on changes
   - Adjust timeline if needed
   - Update success criteria if relevant

4. **Execute and document**
   - Do the work
   - Document what changed
   - Update status and timeline

## 🎯 Common Scope Creep Scenarios

**"Can you also do X?"**

- Acknowledge: "That's a good idea"
- Check scope: "That's not in our current scope"
- Park it: "Let's add that to the post-POC roadmap"
- Or assess: "That would require [X] - should we adjust scope?"

**"I thought X was included"**

- Refer to scope document
- "According to our scope doc, we agreed on [Y], not [X]"
- If it's reasonable: "We can add it, but it will [impact timeline]"
- If it's not: "That wasn't in scope, but we can discuss adding it"

**"While you're at it, can you..."**

- Don't automatically say yes
- "Let me check if that's in scope"
- "That would be [impact] - should we adjust scope?"
- Park it if it's not critical

**Success Criteria Expanding**

- "We originally agreed on [X] success criteria"
- "Adding [Y] would change the scope"
- "Should we adjust the scope document to include this?"

## 🎯 Saying No (Gracefully)

**When to Say No**

- Request is clearly out of scope
- It would significantly impact timeline
- It's not critical to their evaluation
- You've already accommodated other scope changes

**How to Say No**

- Acknowledge the request
- Explain why it's out of scope
- Offer alternatives (post-POC, phase 2, etc.)
- Don't be apologetic - scope exists for a reason

Example: "I understand you'd like [X]. That's not in our current scope, which
we agreed was focused on [Y]. We can definitely add [X] to a follow-up phase
or post-POC roadmap. For now, let's focus on validating [Y] so we can move
forward with confidence."

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Saying yes to everything - scope creep compounds
- Not documenting scope changes - they add up silently
- Not referring back to scope doc - customer forgets what was agreed
- Letting small additions accumulate - they become big
- Not assessing impact - small requests can have big consequences
- Being afraid to say no - scope exists for a reason
