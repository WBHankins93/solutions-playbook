## Demo Recovery

## 📝 Context

The demo went wrong - something broke, didn't work as expected, or the customer
isn't engaged. Don't panic. Recover gracefully and salvage the situation.

## 📋 Immediate Response Checklist

- [ ] Stay calm - don't let them see you panic
- [ ] Acknowledge the issue directly
- [ ] Have a backup plan ready (recorded demo, screenshots, different approach)
- [ ] Don't make excuses or blame the environment
- [ ] Focus on what you can show that works
- [ ] Keep the conversation going - don't go silent

## 🎯 Recovery Strategies

**If Something Breaks During Demo**

1. **Acknowledge and pivot**
   - "Let me show you how this should work" (use backup)
   - "This is a great example of why we have [backup/redundancy/process]"
   - Don't spend more than 30 seconds trying to fix it live

2. **Use your backup plan**
   - Switch to recorded demo if you have one
   - Use screenshots to walk through the workflow
   - Show documentation or architecture diagrams
   - Explain the workflow conceptually

3. **Refocus on value**
   - "While that's loading, let me explain how this solves [their problem]"
   - Shift to discussing their use case and requirements
   - Talk about how others have used this successfully

4. **Offer follow-up**
   - "I'd like to show you this working properly - can we schedule a quick follow-up?"
   - "Let me get this fixed and show you a working demo this week"

**If They're Not Engaged**

1. **Check in directly**
   - "Is this what you were hoping to see?"
   - "What questions do you have so far?"
   - "What's most important for you to understand?"

2. **Pivot to their priorities**
   - Ask what they care about most
   - Focus on that specific use case
   - Skip the generic product tour

3. **Make it interactive**
   - Have them drive (if possible)
   - Ask them to describe their workflow
   - Show how your solution fits their process

**If They're Skeptical or Negative**

1. **Listen to concerns**
   - Don't get defensive
   - Understand what's driving their skepticism
   - Acknowledge their concerns

2. **Address directly**
   - "I hear your concern about [X]. Here's how we address that..."
   - Share relevant case studies or examples
   - Offer to connect them with similar customers

3. **Don't oversell**
   - Be honest about limitations
   - Focus on what you do well
   - Set realistic expectations

## 🎯 Post-Demo Recovery

**Immediate Follow-Up** (within 24 hours)

- Send email acknowledging the issue
- Offer to reschedule or do a follow-up demo
- Share any resources or documentation
- Address any concerns they raised

**If You Need to Reschedule**

- Don't make excuses
- Be proactive: "I'd like to show you this working properly"
- Schedule within a few days if possible
- Come prepared with a working demo

**Internal Debrief**

- What went wrong and why?
- What could have prevented it?
- How did you recover?
- What should you do differently next time?

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Panicking visibly - stay calm and professional
- Making excuses - acknowledge and move forward
- Spending too long trying to fix it - pivot quickly
- Not having a backup plan - always have one
- Ignoring their concerns - address them directly
- Not following up - always follow up after a bad demo
