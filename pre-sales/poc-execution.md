## POC Execution

## 📝 Context

You've scoped the POC and have approval. Now you're executing it. The goal is to
validate the success criteria, demonstrate value, and move toward a decision -
while managing scope and expectations.

## 📋 Pre-Execution Checklist

- [ ] POC scope is documented and approved
- [ ] Environment access is granted and tested
- [ ] Artifacts are available (images, charts, docs)
- [ ] Success criteria are clear and measurable
- [ ] Communication channel is established
- [ ] Kickoff call is scheduled
- [ ] Timeline and milestones are agreed upon

## 🎯 POC Execution Phases

**Phase 1: Environment Setup** ⏱️ Days 1-2

- Validate environment access
- Deploy base components
- Verify networking and connectivity
- Document any deviations from expected setup
- Confirm with customer that environment is ready

**Phase 2: Core Deployment** ⏱️ Days 2-4

- Deploy the solution
- Configure for their use case
- Run initial smoke tests
- Validate basic functionality
- Get early feedback

**Phase 3: Use Case Validation** ⏱️ Days 4-7

- Execute the core use cases from scope
- Validate against success criteria
- Document results and screenshots
- Address any issues that come up
- Keep customer engaged and informed

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing** ⏱️ Days 7-10

- Connect to their systems (if in scope)
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Validate performance requirements (if applicable)
- Security/compliance validation
- Customer testing and validation

**Phase 5: Validation & Sign-Off** ⏱️ Days 10-12

- Run through success criteria checklist
- Demo results to stakeholders
- Document what was accomplished
- Address any remaining concerns
- Get sign-off or identify next steps

### During POC Execution

**Communication**

- Daily or every-other-day updates (brief, not lengthy)
- Share wins and blockers transparently
- Don't go silent - even if stuck
- Schedule regular check-ins ⏱️ weekly minimum

**Scope Management**

- If they ask for something out of scope, acknowledge and park it
- "That's a great idea - let's add it to the post-POC roadmap"
- Don't say yes to everything - refer back to scope document
- If scope needs to change, document it and get approval

**Issue Management**

- Timebox troubleshooting ⏱️ 30-60 min before asking for help
- Document issues and resolutions
- Don't hide problems - be transparent
- Escalate blockers early

**Validation**

- Validate incrementally, not just at the end
- Get customer feedback throughout
- Document evidence of success criteria
- Take screenshots and notes

## 📋 Success Criteria Checklist

Run through this with the customer at the end:

- [ ] [Success criterion 1] - [Evidence/Result]
- [ ] [Success criterion 2] - [Evidence/Result]
- [ ] [Success criterion 3] - [Evidence/Result]

## 📋 Post-POC Checklist

- [ ] Document POC results and outcomes
- [ ] Share findings with sales and internal team
- [ ] Address any open questions or concerns
- [ ] Determine next steps (proceed, expand POC, etc.)
- [ ] Update CRM/tracking system
- [ ] Schedule follow-up call if needed

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Environment isn't ready when you start - build buffer time
- Scope creep during execution - refer back to scope doc
- Customer goes silent - proactively reach out
- Success criteria are vague - clarify early or you'll never "win"
- Not documenting as you go - makes sign-off harder
- Assuming it worked - validate with customer explicitly
