# SE Playbook

An operational guide for Solutions Engineers. Open this when you get assigned
a customer, need to prep for a call, or hit a problem during implementation.

This is not a training manual or product documentation. It's a routing system
and collection of practical frameworks for getting things done.

## Quick Start

Open [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) and find your situation.
