# SE Playbook

**Battle-tested operational frameworks for Solutions Engineers who need to deliver results, not just read docs.**

This is your "what to do right now" playbook. Open it when you get assigned a customer, need to prep for a call in 30 minutes, or hit a blocker during implementation. No theory. Just frameworks, checklists, and templates you can use immediately.

## 🔨 Why I Built This

After years of SE work across healthcare, energy, telecom, tech and enterprise clients, I was repeating the same patterns but documenting them differently each time.

**The problem:** Frameworks scattered across Slack messages, Google Drive docs, and local notes. Discovery questions improvised on every call. POC scope creep because I didn't have consistent frameworks. Recovery strategies reinvented when things broke.

**Without this repo:** Searching old Slack threads for "what questions did I ask?" Re-learning POC scoping patterns between clients. Improvising recovery strategies when demos crash or POCs fail.

**With this repo:** Run better discovery calls with battle-tested question frameworks. Scope POCs that actually win with clear success criteria. Recover from failures with proven strategies. Handle complex environments (air-gapped, private clusters) without reinventing the wheel.

**What you get:** 42 frameworks, checklists, and templates covering the full SE lifecycle—from first discovery call to customer handoff. Copy-paste ready discovery questions, POC scoping templates, environment-specific guides, and recovery strategies tested in enterprise implementations where mistakes are expensive.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

**If you're a Solutions Engineer, Technical Sales Engineer, or Customer Success Engineer**, this repo helps you:

- **Run better discovery calls** with battle-tested question frameworks
- **Scope POCs that actually win** with clear success criteria and scope management
- **Handle complex environments** (air-gapped, private clusters, firewall-restricted) without reinventing the wheel
- **Recover from failures** (demo crashes, POC blockers, scope creep) with proven strategies
- **Coordinate internally** with templates for handoffs, status updates, and escalation
- **Level up your skills** with structured learning paths from Foundations to Advanced

**This is not a training manual or product documentation.** It's a routing system and collection of practical frameworks for getting things done.

**This playbook scales with you, from first-year SE to technical lead.**

## 🏆 Social Proof

**Built from real enterprise implementations** - These frameworks have been battle-tested in:
- Complex air-gapped environments with strict security requirements
- Multi-tenant SaaS deployments with resource constraints
- Enterprise POCs with tight timelines and high stakes
- Hybrid cloud integrations spanning on-prem and public cloud

**Patterns used in production** - Every framework here has been refined through actual customer engagements, not theoretical exercises.
