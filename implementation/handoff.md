## Handoff to Customer / Success Team

## 📝 Context

Implementation is complete and you're ready to hand off to the customer or success
team. The goal is to ensure they can operate and maintain what you've built. Don't
just disappear - set them up for success.

## 📋 Pre-Handoff Checklist

- [ ] All success criteria have been validated
- [ ] Everything is working as expected
- [ ] Documentation is complete (architecture, runbooks, procedures)
- [ ] Customer team has been trained (if applicable)
- [ ] Access and credentials are documented
- [ ] Handoff session is scheduled
- [ ] Success team is briefed (if applicable)

## 🎯 Handoff Preparation

**Document What Was Deployed**

- Configuration details (values, settings, customizations)
- Dependencies and integrations
- Access requirements and credentials
- Network topology and connectivity

**Create Operational Runbooks**

- How to check system health
- How to restart services if needed
- How to view logs and troubleshoot
- How to perform backups (if applicable)
- How to handle common issues
- Escalation procedures

**Prepare Training Materials**

- Architecture diagrams
- Key workflows and processes
- Common tasks and procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ or known issues

## 🎯 Handoff Session

**Agenda** ⏱️ 60-90 min

1. **Overview** (10 min)
   - What was deployed and where
   - Architecture and key components
   - How it fits into their environment

2. **Walkthrough** (30-40 min)
   - Show them how to access the system
   - Demonstrate key workflows
   - Walk through operational procedures
   - Show them where logs and monitoring are

3. **Q&A** (15-20 min)
   - Answer questions about operation
   - Clarify any procedures
   - Address concerns

4. **Next Steps** (5-10 min)
   - Who to contact for support
   - How to get help
   - What happens next (success team, support model)

**During the Session**

- Let them drive - have them perform key tasks
- Don't rush - ensure they understand
- Document questions and answers
- Record the session if possible (with permission)
- Follow up with written summary

## 🎯 Post-Handoff

**Immediate Follow-Up**

- Send handoff documentation within 24 hours
- Share session recording if available
- Provide summary of what was covered
- Include links to all resources
- Confirm they have everything they need

**Transition Period**

- Be available for questions (first week or two)
- Check in after a few days to see how it's going
- Address any gaps in documentation
- Ensure success team is ready (if applicable)

**Final Steps**

- Update CRM/tracking system with handoff status
- Archive project documentation
- Share lessons learned with team
- Complete [retrospective](../lessons/TEMPLATE.md) if applicable

## 🎯 Handoff Document Template

Use the [handoff document template](../templates/handoff-document.md) and include:

- **What was deployed** - Architecture, components, versions
- **How to access it** - URLs, credentials, access methods
- **How to operate it** - Key procedures and workflows
- **How to troubleshoot** - Common issues and solutions
- **Who to contact** - Support channels and escalation
- **Resources** - Documentation, runbooks, links

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Not validating everything works - test before handoff
- Rushing the handoff session - they need time to learn
- Not documenting enough - they'll have questions later
- Assuming they understand - have them demonstrate
- Disappearing immediately - be available for transition period
- Not setting expectations - clarify support model and response times
