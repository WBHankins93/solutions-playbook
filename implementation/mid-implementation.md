## Mid-Implementation Checkpoint

## 📝 Context

You're in the middle of an implementation - past kickoff, but not yet at handoff. This
is when you check progress, validate assumptions, and course-correct if needed. Don't
wait until the end to discover problems.

## 📋 Checkpoint Checklist

- [ ] Review original scope and success criteria
- [ ] Assess current progress against timeline
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks
- [ ] Validate what's been deployed so far
- [ ] Check in with customer on their experience
- [ ] Review any scope changes or additions
- [ ] Update stakeholders on status

## 🎯 Checkpoint Framework

**Assess Progress**

- What's been completed? (Map to original scope)
- What's currently in progress?
- What's remaining?
- Are you on track with the timeline?
- Have any milestones been missed?

**Validate Assumptions**

- Are the environment assumptions still correct?
- Have any constraints changed since kickoff?
- Are the success criteria still relevant?
- Is the customer's availability as expected?
- Are the technical requirements still accurate?

**Check Customer Satisfaction**

- How is the customer feeling about progress?
- Are there any concerns or frustrations?
- Is communication working well?
- Do they understand what's been done?
- Are expectations aligned?

**Identify Risks and Blockers**

- What's blocking progress right now?
- What could block progress in the future?
- Are there any technical risks?
- Are there any timeline risks?
- Are there any relationship risks?

## 🎯 Checkpoint Actions

**Week 2-3 Checkpoint** (for longer implementations)

- Review progress against Phase 1-2 goals
- Validate environment setup is complete
- Confirm artifacts are staged and accessible
- Check that communication cadence is working
- Identify any early blockers

**Mid-Point Checkpoint** (halfway through timeline)

- Comprehensive progress review
- Validate all completed phases
- Review any scope changes
- Assess timeline and adjust if needed
- Get customer feedback on experience so far

**Pre-Handoff Checkpoint** (1-2 weeks before handoff)

- Review all success criteria
- Validate everything is working
- Identify any gaps before handoff
- Prepare handoff documentation
- Schedule handoff session

## 🎯 Course Correction

**If Behind Schedule**

- Identify root cause (scope creep, blockers, environment issues?)
- Assess if timeline can be adjusted
- Communicate proactively with customer
- Prioritize must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- Escalate if timeline is unrealistic

**If Scope Has Changed**

- Document what changed and why
- Assess impact on timeline and resources
- Get customer approval for changes
- Update success criteria if needed
- Don't let scope creep silently

**If Customer Is Unhappy**

- Understand the root cause
- Address concerns directly
- Adjust approach if needed
- Communicate more frequently
- Escalate if relationship is at risk

## ⚠️ Gotchas

- Not checking in regularly - problems compound
- Assuming everything is fine - validate with customer
- Ignoring scope changes - they add up quickly
- Not documenting progress - makes handoff harder
- Waiting until the end to validate - course-correct early
