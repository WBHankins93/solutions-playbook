**Title/Opening Hook:**
"Three years ago, I walked into a discovery call with a Fortune 500 customer and completely blanked on what questions to ask. The call went sideways, and I spent the next week scrambling to recover.

That moment made me realize: Solutions Engineering is 80% pattern recognition, but most of us learn those patterns the hard way—through failure.

**The Pattern:**
Every SE faces the same moments of panic:
- Discovery call in 30 minutes and you're not sure what to ask
- POC is failing and you don't know how to recover
- Customer is escalating and you need a framework, not improvisation
- Air-gapped deployment with no internet and you're stuck

The problem? There's no playbook. You either figure it out yourself or learn from someone who's been there.

**The Solution:**
I've spent the last few years documenting every framework, checklist, and template that actually works in real customer engagements. Not theory. Not best practices from a blog. Actual patterns that have been battle-tested in:
- Complex air-gapped environments
- Enterprise POCs with tight timelines
- Multi-tenant deployments with resource constraints
- Recovery scenarios when things go wrong

The result: **SE Playbook** - 42 complete guides covering the full lifecycle from first discovery call to customer handoff.

**What's inside:**
- Copy-paste discovery question frameworks (50+ questions organized by category)
- POC scoping templates with success criteria
- Environment-specific guides (air-gapped, private clusters, firewall-restricted)
- Recovery strategies for when demos crash or POCs fail
- Internal coordination templates for handoffs and status updates
- Structured learning paths from Foundations to Advanced

**Why I'm sharing this:**
Because SE work shouldn't be learned through trial and error. If you're a Solutions Engineer, Technical Sales Engineer, or Customer Success Engineer, this playbook scales with you from first-year SE to technical lead.

**The ask:**
Check it out. Use it. Give me feedback. If you have patterns that work, contribute them. Let's make SE work less about reinventing the wheel and more about delivering results.

### r/devops

**Title:** Here's the playbook I wish I had as an SE

**Body:**
Three years into Solutions Engineering, I realized I was still winging it on discovery calls and POC scoping. Every engagement felt like starting from scratch.

So I started documenting what actually works—the frameworks, checklists, and templates that get reused across real customer engagements. Not theory. Just patterns that work.

**What's in it:**
- Discovery question frameworks (50+ questions organized by infrastructure, security, compliance)
- POC scoping templates with success criteria and scope management
- Environment-specific guides (air-gapped, private clusters, firewall-restricted, multi-tenant)
- Recovery strategies for when demos crash or POCs fail
- Internal coordination templates (handoffs, status updates, escalation)
- Structured learning paths if you're new to SE work

**42 complete guides** covering the full lifecycle from first discovery call to customer handoff.

Built from real enterprise implementations—air-gapped deployments, multi-tenant SaaS, hybrid cloud integrations. Every framework has been refined through actual customer engagements.

**Why share:**
Because SE work shouldn't be learned through trial and error. If you're doing pre-sales, implementations, or customer success work, this might save you some pain.

Open to feedback, contributions, and real-world additions. What patterns have worked for you?

**Title:** Here's the playbook I wish I had as an SE

**Body:**
Been doing Solutions Engineering for a few years now, and I kept finding myself in the same situations:
- Discovery call tomorrow, not sure what questions to ask
- POC is failing and need a recovery framework
- Air-gapped deployment with no internet, stuck on validation
- Customer escalating, need a structured response

Started documenting the patterns that actually work in real engagements. Not best practices from blogs—actual frameworks that have been battle-tested in enterprise environments.

**What's inside:**
- Discovery call frameworks with 50+ questions (infrastructure, security, compliance, operations)
- POC scoping templates with success criteria
- Environment guides: air-gapped, private clusters, firewall-restricted, multi-tenant, hybrid
- Recovery strategies: demo failures, POC recovery, scope creep management
- Internal coordination: handoffs, status updates, escalation frameworks
- Learning paths for skill development

**42 guides total** covering the full SE lifecycle.

Built from real implementations—complex air-gapped environments, multi-tenant deployments, enterprise POCs. Every pattern has been refined through actual customer work.

If you're doing platform engineering, pre-sales, or customer-facing technical work, this might be useful. Open to feedback and contributions.

## Posting Tips

### LinkedIn
- Post during business hours (9am-5pm EST)
- Include the link in the first comment (not the post itself for better engagement)
- Tag relevant people/companies if appropriate
- Respond to comments within 24 hours
- Consider a follow-up post sharing a specific framework that got good engagement

### Reddit
- Read subreddit rules first (some don't allow GitHub links in titles)
- Post at different times to test engagement
- Engage authentically in comments—don't just drop and run
- Be ready for criticism—Reddit values authenticity over polish
- Consider posting in one subreddit first, then others after a few days
